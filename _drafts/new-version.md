I updated the application to include new App Privacy information. This information tells users about the data the application collects and how it uses it. Users can review the App Privacy section in App Store and decide whether they want to download and use the app.

The good news is that Math Done Write does not collect any data, period. All information stays on the device. The only time data leaves the application is when the user decides to share test results using email or text message, and only if email and texting are enabled.

I also made few small changes to improve page rendering on new iPhones with larger screens. And the application now links to the new location of the contact page that now lives on GitHub Pages.

Enjoy playing with math.
